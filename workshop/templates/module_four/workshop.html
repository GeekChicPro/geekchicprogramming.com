    <p class="muted">Time to Success: 45-60 minutes</p>

    <p>In this module we're going to teach you how to write again. The first time you
    learned how to write, you learned about the structure of documents: an introduction,
    the body, and then a conclusion. Structure is so important to the understanding of
    documents that we create specialized headings and sections to better break down a
    large piece of content for the consumption of our human audience. Generally speaking,
    the way that we <em>format</em> those typographic elements gives visual cues to our
    readers about how best to approach these sections, for example a short statement that
    is big and bold is probably a chapter heading.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, computers do not understand visual formating clues to interpret 
    documents, and it is just as important for computers to understand human documents
    as it is for humans to do so- so that they can render them in a way we can understand.
    In order for a computer to understand the structure of a document, we use something 
    called a <em>markup language</em>, and in particular we will be dealing with HTML5
    in this workshop.</p>

    <p>So today's task will be to get you to seperate <em>structure</em> from <em>format</em>
    in a document, and along the way, we'll create an HTML profile page for you.</p>

    <p class="well">Create an HTML5 Profile page</p>

    </ul>

    <p>Keep in mind that you're going to need a text editor for this workshop, as well
    as a Web Browser - particularly Chrome or Firefox would be great!</p>

    <hr />
    <h3 id="basicmarkup">A Basic Web Document</h3>
    
    <p>All HTML5 web pages are required to have the following elements:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A doctype, for HTML5 this is: <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code></li>
        <li>A single <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag -- all other tags will be inside this tag.</li>
        <li>A single <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> as the two children of the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag</li>
        <li>A <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag inside of the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Open up your basic text editor and type in the following:</p>
    <pre>

 &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
 &lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My Awesome Profile&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;

 &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>Save the document on your desktop as "profile.html" - note that if you have
    Windows or an editor that defines the file type, set the type as "All Files" or
    "HTML".</p>

    <p>Double click the profile.html file on your desktop. It should automatically
    open a Browser window... with nothing in it. But hey- look! You're title is at
    the top of the browser tab! If you had trouble opening the file, please let an
    instructor know. To fix this you can right-click and select "open with" and select
    a Browser. If it opens in a text editor, it is probably saved as "profile.html.txt"</p>

    <p>Let's fix the emptiness. Inside of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag, insert the
    following:</p>

    <pre>

&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;My Awesome Profile Page!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>Reload the page by pressing CTRL + R or CMD + R or F5 or by simply hitting the
    refresh button. A big, bold version of "My Awesome Profile Page!" should appear.</p>

    <h4>A few discussion points</h4>
    <p>As you can see, the basic structure of any HTML page is a head and a body. The
    head describes the document, including things like its title, and many other useful
    things as well. The body contains the content of the document. This is starting to
    seem pretty familiar!</p>

    <p>A few other things you can put in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag are things
    called <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags -- these tags describe the document to the
    computer, including things like encoding, language, authorship, descriptions, and
    more. These tags are used in particular by search engines to categorize the Internet.</p>

    <p>Add the following in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of your document:</p>

    <pre>
 
 &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My Awesome Profile Page!&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;meta name="author" content="Me"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="keywords" content="profile, me, awesome"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="description" content="All about me!"&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>There, now Google can find you! This is so common, that web developers have standardized
    the template for HTML5 docs, the best one is the 
    <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> - but this is a bit
    advanced, so don't bounce over there quite yet!</p>

    <hr />
    <h3 id="addingcontent">Adding Content</h3>

    <p>Ok, now on to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> -- let's get some stuff into our
    awesome profile!</p>

    <p class="text-success">Note - I'm merely making suggestions here, add as much
    content as you'd like to, not just what I'm suggesting! See the
    <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3C Tag Reference</a> for a complete
    tag reference if you need a little inspiration.</p>

    <p>First add some sections:<p>

    <pre>

 &lt;h2&gt;About Me&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;My Favorite Things&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Music&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Movies&lt;/h3&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>You'll notice when you refresh the page that your Browser renders these
    headings like you'd expect. Both you and the computer are able to detect the 
    structure of the document with just a little markup!</p>

    <p>Add some <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags with a short biography under the About section.</p>

    <p>Let's also add some links to our social media:</p>

    <pre>
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow me:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/username"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://facebook.com/username"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://linkedin.com/in/username"&gt;Linked In&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>List your favorite music and movies in those sections using <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> tags
    to create ordered lists.</p>
    
    <h4>A bit more discussion</h4>
    <p>All this markup is read by the Browser and is translated into what you're seeing on
    the browser page, in fact - different browsers will treat the markup slightly differently.
    If you have a different Web Browser installed, try opening your document up in that one
    and seeing the difference! Web designers have to use styles to apply universal formatting
    to their documents, we'll get into that later.</p>

    <p>Also, since every web page is essentially markup, most browsers will allow you to see
    the raw tags. In Chrome, for instance, right click on the page and click "Inspect Element"
    this will bring up a tab with the raw HTML that's underneath. You can inspect ANY webpage
    this way, but beware, it can be a jungle of markup out there!</p>

    <p class="text-success">Ask your instructor how to view the raw HTML in your browser.</p>

    <hr />
    <h3 id="gravatar">A Profile Picture</h3>

    <p>Images and other resources like stylesheets, scripts, and even sounds and music can be
    linked to and added as resources in web documents. You can use the file structure to have
    the browser automatically fetch these images- but we're going to use a resource on the
    Internet - a <a href="http://gravatar.com">Globally Recognized Avatar (Gravatar)</a> that
    you can manipulate and upload without worrying about server resources.</p>

    <p>Go to <a href="https://en.gravatar.com/">https://en.gravatar.com/</a> and sign in or
    create a new account. Select your gravatar or upload a new photo of yourself. Once you
    have assigned the Gravar to your email- select the "link" button in the My Emails page
    and copy the link, which should look something like:</p>

    <p class="well">wwww.gravatar.com/avatar/5dad8ad2a5bd5773bc08edeea9b27aa1.png</p>

    <p>Add the gravatar to your profile:</p>

    <pre>

 &lt;img src="http://wwww.gravatar.com/avatar/5dad8ad2a5bd5773bc08edeea9b27aa1.png" alt='Profile' title='Me' /&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>If you're having trouble with Internet connections, simply move an image into the same
    working directory as the profile.index file. Then simply add the name of the image without
    any path information to the src attribute.</p>

    <hr />
    <h3 id="bootstrap">Styling it Up with CSS (and Bootstrap)</h3>

    <p>Actual format of web documents is done using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Although
    a full discussion on CSS is beyond the scope of this workshop; here's a bit of a preview.</p>

    <pre>
 &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
     body {
        background-color: white;
     }

     p {
        color: black;
        font-size: 16px;
        font-family: serif;
        line-height: 18px;
     }

     ul.horizontal li {
         display: inline;
     }
 &lt;/style&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>Essentially what CSS does is allow you to specify exactly how each of our HTML elements
    should look by laying out formating properties for each of the elements. Additionally, CSS
    allows you to specify classes (that's the .horizontal after the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> 
    tag) to specifically style a set of elements. To add a class to your elements, set it in
    the class attribute:</p>

    <pre>

 &lt;ul class="horizontal"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;List Item One&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;List Item Two&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>The best place to put <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags is in the head of your html document.
    You can also link to them as external documents, or add styles directly to tags with the
    style attribute. In fact, this is where the term Cascading comes from. Styles are applied in
    this precedence: styles on the tag, styles in the document, external style documents.</p>

    <h4>Bootstrap</h4>
    <p>Rather than get you to write CSS, I highly recommend using the 
    <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> framework to quickly add an
    elegant, and universal style to your web documents. You may notice that these pages are also
    in Bootstrap!</p>

    <p>Add the following to your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> block, after all the metas:</p>

    <pre>

 &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="txt/css" 
    href="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/twitter-bootstrap/2.3.1/css/bootstrap-combined.min.css" /&gt;
    </pre>
    
    <p>When you refresh your page, everything should look different! You can now add Bootstrap
    markup to your document to more specifically control what is happening. Let's add the following
    markup to center your document on the page and clean things up a bit:</p>

    <pre>

 &lt;body&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
        &lt;div class="row"&gt;
            &lt;div class="span12"&gt;

               [Your content here]

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;/body&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>Feel free to use the excellent documents from <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>
    to continue to add markup to your page that will format it.</p>

    <hr />
    <h3 id="javascript">A note on Interactivity</h3>

    <p>The final piece that is is missing with front end development is some sort of interactivity.
    Web documents have moved beyond simple information giving things to full blown applications. 
    Because of this some user interaction with the document is required. To accomplish this, we use
    JavaScript.</p>

    <p>Again, JavaScript is beyond the scope of this workshop, but if you do intend to become a
    front end web developer, then that trinity - HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript will be your bread and
    butter.</p>

    <p>To very quickly and easily develop JavaScript on all Browsers, we use a library called
    <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> - a selector engine for your document. To try it out,
    add the following to your document, in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> block after the style
    sheet link.</p>

    <pre>

 &lt;head&gt;
    
    ...

    &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
        
        $(document).ready(function() {
            $("p").click(function() {
                $(this).toggleClass('text-success');
            });
        });

    &lt;/script&gt;

 &lt;/head&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>Now go click on some of your paragraphs -- they should turn green when you click them,
    and then back to black when you click on them again! (This step also assumes you have
    the Bootstrap stylesheet added to your document).</p>
