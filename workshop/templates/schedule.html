	<p class=”lead”>Get GeekChic Programming Workshop for Women</p>
	<p>The Get GeekChic workshop will provide a comfortable environment for women to network, learn about computer programming, and see if computer science may be a field you’re interested in pursuing. In just one weekend, we’ll introduce Python, demonstrate the command line, and start coding! </p>

    <p class="center"><a href="//docs.google.com/forms/d/1b5mpTc4YwCUL2sB8Wc-9wJNR-_Sy1poNbxhGQNq9yTw/viewform" title="Register for the workshop" class="btn btn-inverse">Register Now!</a></p>

	<p><strong>Friday 5/31, 7:00 - 9:00 PM:</strong><br /> Come get everything installed on your computer and network with your cohort. We'll provide refreshments and an opportunity for everyone to get to know each other.</p>

	<p><strong>Saturday 6/1, 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM:</strong><br /> Instruction and guided practice as you learn and test your spiffy new programming skills. We’ll cover the command line, Python, HTML 5 & CSS 3, and Django. Lunch is provided.</p>

	<p><strong>Saturday 6/1, 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM:</strong><br /> Workshop after-party at The Big Hunt. Join your teachers and fellow students for drinks and discussion about what you learned and how to continue learning.</p>

	<p><em>**Both the Friday & Saturday sessions are required. The workshop after-party is optional, but we hope you can attend!</em></p>

	<h3>Location:</h3>
	<p><strong>Sunlight Foundation</strong><br/>

	<h3>What to Bring?</h3>
	<p>Your laptop and a desire to learn something new!</p>
	<h3>Who's Teaching?</h3>

	<p><em>Benjamin Bengfort</em><br />
	All around nice guy with two sisters and a baby girl who are the absolute bomb, Ben has developed Python applications for the past 8 years for publishers, intelligence agencies, and startups. He can count the girls in his graduate cohort on one hand but knows that all it takes to code is a little imagination (no matter what the movies say).</p>

	<p><em>Sean Patrick Murphy</em><br/>
	With degrees in math, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering and an MBA from Oxford, Sean has served as a senior scientist at Johns Hopkins University for over a decade, advises several startups, and provides learning analytics consulting for EverFi. Previously, he served as the Chief Data Scientist at a series A funded health care analytics firm, and the Director of Research of Manhattan Prep, an elite graduate educational company. He has also cofounded a big data startup and Data Community DC, a 4,000 member organization of data professionals.</p>

	<h4>Teaching Assistants</h4>
	<p><em>Jennifer Rullman</em><br/>
	Jennifer began her career with a deep love of software development. She says there's nothing more satisfying than building something - taking abstract ideas that exist only in your head, laying down layers of code that build up to a product, and seeing the user's face light up at a problem well-solved. These days her love of building things has expanded to all aspects of creating and running a software company. As the Founder of Red Monocle Jennifer is a full-stack company builder, responsible for defining strategy, designing user experience, coding software, promoting marketing, and closing sales.</p>

	<p><em>Josannah Keller</em><br/>
	Josie is the CEO & Co-founder of GeekChic Programming. A programming student herself, she got her introduction to startups and computer science at the same time, while heading the marketing efforts at Unbound Concepts. She was inspired by the innovative power of the development team and decided to fine tune her own drive and creative power by learning to code. What she found was a lack of programs in the DC area and a lack of women to turn to for advice -- and so GeekChic was born.</p>

	<h3>Cost</h3>
	<p>$50</p>
	<h3>Why should YOU learn to program?</h3>
	<p>GeekChic Programming encourages women to transform technology by applying the skills they learn in our programming workshops and classes to explore innovative solutions to real-world problems. Over the last three years, President Obama has continued to emphasize the importance of STEM in education reform. The White House is committed to expanding STEM education and career opportunities for underrepresented groups, including women and girls, and the global job marketplace shows that these technical skills are in extremely high demand. There is a demonstrated need for women in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math, and software is at the center of every STEM project.</p>

	<p>We hope you can make it! Please contact us if you have any questions.</p>
